# Python keyboard shortcuts

A simple and useful script to save time when writing the same code or text using shortcuts.

This repository contains only 2 files:
* keywords.txt
* app.py

### keywords.txt

You can write as many shortcuts as you like in this file.
Before writing a shortcut, keep in mind that each shortcut is divided by `----`.

To write a shortcut, the first line is the `shortcut` as such and the` generated text` must be written below our "shortcut" like this.

### app.py

This is the script you must run to use all the shortcuts registered in your `keywords.txt`

''
$ python app.py
''

Now you can try your shortcuts
